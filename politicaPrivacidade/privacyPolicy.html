		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Clockin.it. We are committed to protecting personal information and the right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about
			this privacy policy or our practices with regards to personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:policy@clockin.it">policy@clockin.it</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy describes how Clockin.it ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and makes accessible information in connection with your use of our Clockin.it Register mobile
			application (the "App"). This App is specifically designed for use by authorized personnel, such as HR Managers of our client companies ("Clients"), to register facial biometric data of
			their employees ("Employees") for use within the Clockin.it time tracking system.
		</p>

		<p>
			This policy primarily addresses the data processed through the App by the HR Manager. The handling of the Employee biometric data registered via this App is also governed by the privacy
			policies applicable to the Clockin.it services used by the Employee (e.g., Clockin.it Single) and the Client's own privacy policies, as the Client is the data controller for their
			Employee's data.
		</p>

		<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
		<p>We collect information necessary to provide the App's registration functionalities and to manage the biometric data within the Clockin.it ecosystem:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Information Collected or Provided via the App:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Employee Photos:</strong> The core function of the App involves capturing or uploading photos of Employees. This requires in-app permission to access the device Camera
						or Photo Gallery.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Biometric Data:</strong> We process the uploaded Employee photos using biometric recognition analysis to extract the facial landmarks and then generate corresponding
						biometric data templates.
					</li>
					<li><strong>HR Manager Account Information:</strong> Basic information required to log in and use the App (provided by your employer/our Client).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>

					<li><strong>Usage and Performance Data:</strong> We use tools like Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and aggregated usage data.</li>
					<li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> The App requests access to the device's Advertising ID for analytics purposes.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
